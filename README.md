# 🚀 TestTask Project

Project developed for the Front-end developer position in Abz Agency. It was developed based on a mockup provided in Figma, route consumption documentation in Swagger, and a document with information to be followed.
The development used the React, Typescript, and Vite stack, along with SASS (Scss) for styling. The layout is responsive, with a maximum width of 1170px, as specified in the design.

It was hosted on Vercel.
